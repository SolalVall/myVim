# Vim Project
Really short project, to save and update my vim custom configuration over time.

Usage: Just have to clone it in your home directory AND RUN INIT.SH SCRIPT for installing structure, pathogen and plugins.

Thanks to:
 * Kristijan Husak for the color scheme
 * Ian Young for yaml indentation
