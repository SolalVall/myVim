# Vim Project
Really short project, to save and update my vim custom configuration over time.

Work for RedHat, Debian MacOSx based OS

if you have another based OS please run init.sh with your package manager:
	-	./init.sh pacman (example for Arch Linux)

Usage: 
	- Clone prject
	- run init.sh script

Thanks to:
 * Kristijan Husak for the color scheme
 * Ian Young for yaml indentation
