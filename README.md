# Vim Project
Really short project, to save and update my vim custom configuration over time.

ATTENTION: It will ERASE you actual vim conf

Usage for RedHat, Debian MacOSx based OS: 
* Clone prject
* run init.sh script
	
Usage for an another based OS please run init.sh with your package manager:
* ./init.sh pacman (example for Arch Linux)

Thanks to:
 * Kristijan Husak for the color scheme
 * Ian Young for yaml indentation
